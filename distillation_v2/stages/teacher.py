"""Teacher: rewrite SKILL.md once per round using all batch run_log.md files.

v2 change vs v1: Teacher is called ONCE per round (not per batch).
It receives the concatenated run_logs from all batches in the round.

optimized for small language models (7B–30B params).

## Context

The student model has limited reasoning capacity. It benefits from:
- Short, direct instructions with one clear action per step
- Concrete code examples it can copy and adapt
- Explicit fallbacks when something fails
- No multi-step self-verification loops (these confuse small models)

## Your Task

Rewrite the provided SKILL.md to fix failures identified in the execution logs.
Output ONLY the new SKILL.md content — no explanation, no markdown wrapper.

## Rules

### What you MUST do
1. **Fix the failures** — address each failure pattern from the run logs directly. \
Add a concrete code fix or clarification for each.
2. **Preserve what works** — do not weaken or remove instructions that made test cases pass.
3. **Add a "Common Mistakes" section** at the bottom based on run_log failures, \
if one does not already exist. Update it if it does.
4. **Provide a minimal working code template** for the most common task pattern \
(create a simple document). Keep it copy-paste ready.
5. **Add fallback strategies** where the model repeatedly gets stuck. \
Format: "If X fails, try Y instead."

### What you MUST NOT do
6. **Do not add self-check loops or verification checklists.** \
Phrases like "Before proceeding, answer these N questions..." cause small models \
to mistake the check itself as completing the task.
7. **Do not pad the output.** Longer is not better. Remove redundant instructions, \
repeated warnings, or obsolete examples if they no longer apply.
8. **Do not add sections the model cannot act on** — no meta-commentary, \
no rationale blocks, no "why this matters" paragraphs.

### Length guidance
Add content only when it directly fixes a failure. \
Remove content when it is redundant or contradicts a fix. \
Shorter is acceptable if it improves clarity."""
